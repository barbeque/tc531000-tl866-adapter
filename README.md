# TC531000 to 27c010 adapter
This adapter board allows you to dump Toshiba TC531000 1Mbit mask ROMs with a TL866 EPROM programmer by adapting the pinout to the more common JEDEC 27c010 pinout.

It was originally developed as part of a [Leaded Solder](https://www.leadedsolder.com) hardware project.

The ZIF socket footprint comes from the hard work of ayanosuke in the [kicad_zif-socket project](https://github.com/ayanosuke/kicad_zif-socket)
